MOGGYMID.ASM - z80 assembly files should be compiled with FASM available on the zx81 forum here https://www.sinclairzxworld.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1064
		contains header files ect needed to compile correctly.

MOGGYMID.P - pre assempled p file for use on zx81 equiped with zxpand+ and a suitable midi device attached.

This player accepts any number of pre coverted midi files but expects them to be name 1.ZXM 2.ZXM 3.ZXM .... 99997.ZXM 99998.ZXM 99999.ZXM
When first run it will ask for a number upon been given a number midi playback will start at that numbered file and increment by 1 each time.

Known bugs... long empty non midi event pauses will cause premature exit from playback and next track will play.

Thats all i wrote :-)
