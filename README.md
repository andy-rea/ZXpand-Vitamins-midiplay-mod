# midi-play mod

modified ASM to detect last frame and stop playback of midi file
basic prog then loads next file and starts play.

files should be numbered
1.zxm
2.zxm
3.zxm

ect.

on startng the player you are prompted for a start track number.
plyback wil start from that track and continue sequencially in an
assending order.

Future goals :- support Playlist, which will enable more descriptive
filename... however still in the  8.3 format expected by ZXpand.
