# ZXpand-Vitamins

Here you will find toys to enhance your ZXpanding pleasure :D

Head over [to the wiki](https://github.com/charlierobson/ZXpand-Vitamins/wiki/ZXpand---Online-Manual) to find the Fine Manual which you may read at your leisure.

Grab some PCB designs to build your very own [Turbo AY](https://github.com/charlierobson/ZXpand-Vitamins/tree/master/turbo-pcb) or [serial breakout](https://github.com/charlierobson/ZXpand-Vitamins/tree/master/serial-breakout) board!

If you're a developer you might find it useful to upload your work using a serial connection, to save card swapping - in this case you'll need the [serial server](https://github.com/charlierobson/ZXpand-Vitamins/tree/master/serial-server) program and knowledge of the mythical LOAD "$" command..!
